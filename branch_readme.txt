Branch contains the prototype codes I might write before starting my main
attempt. In this case, I would explore:
  How to take input from the command line
  How to conveniently display and signal the correctness of the guess
  How to handle a list of words, and check whether a word is a dictionary word

This branch also contains a small awk script I used to filter my word list. This
is not important, but does illustrate that I might often write other bits of code
to process data and create a dedicated input file. This is generally a cleaner approach
than polluting my main code with processing logic WHEN my inputs are fixed, OR already
need pre-processing. Separate responsibilities where possible!

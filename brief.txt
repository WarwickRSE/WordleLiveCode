**The game **

Wordle (here werdle) is a word guessing game. A word of a fixed number of letters
is randomly selected, and a player then guesses what it could be. After each guess
the game reports to the player whether they have guessed a:
  correct letter in the correct place
  correct letter, but in the wrong place
  incorrect letter

The player then guesses again, until they are correct OR have used a fixed
number of guesses. 

NOTE: a correct letter in the wrong place, can occur only once per letter in the
test word. So when guessing the word "cliff", a guess of "hello" would only
signal this once, for the first 'l' in the guess. 

Usually, every guess must be a valid dictionary word, preventing a player from
simply trialling letters one by one, or using guesses such as "abcde".
